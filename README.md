## Swarm of Drones Simulation Testbed

The autonomous swarm of drones is a hot topic nowadays. The aim of this project is to provide an experimental platform for conducting testing on swarm of drones in a simulated environment.  The droneâ€™s flight is modelled based on boids algorithm using Repast Simphony as agent-based modeling toolkit. The drones have cameras being able to identify and engage targets in their area of responsibility. In order to have a more realistic visual representation of simulated world, Three.js is employed to display 3D animated objects.
